Background

Jacob was born and raised in Australia. He thought he would spend most of his career there, but things went down a different route.

He joined Coinbase as a design intern in 2017, spending over three years there, primarily focusing on USDC and stablecoin products. While at Coinbase, Jacob was pushing for products to be more onchain.

At the time Uniswap was starting up, and Unisocks grabbed Jacobâ€™s attention. He was interested in the potential for crypto to help capture value around creative projects and created experiments using Uniswap contracts like the St-Fame DAO and long sleeves drop.

For the past three years, Jacob's primary focus has been Zora, an NFT protocol and application.

The Zora team recently helped Jack Butcher in his NFT experiment, developing custom code for the Opepen collection.
